# Hierarchy window : Technical Document
## Context

I had to make a hierarchy window tool for the AerRacers project of the 3rd years. I am using the Neko Engine and the tool is for the Neko Engine as well.

## Needs for the tool

The hierarchy needs to be able to view entities, their children, select an entity, drag and drop them as well as add or delete an entity.

## Interface overview

The window is called Hierarchy and you can see each entity and their children.
